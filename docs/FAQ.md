# FAQ

## Q: Do I have to use conda to install requirements?<br>
A: No, although it is recommended for easy installation and GPU usage (see below). Requirements can be installed manually through pip. 


## Q: Why is there no data included in this repository?<br>
A: The dataset used in the creation of this project is not yet publicly available. If it becomes available in the future, it will be linked to from this respository.

## Q: How do I utilize GPU for training?
A: If a compatible GPU is available and requirements were installed using conda, model training should automatically utilize GPU. The conda package `tensorflow-gpu` included in the environment automatically installs libraries required for GPU training.

## Q: What do the heatmaps represent?
A: The heatmaps output by the model training process represent the confusion matrix generated by the model output. If multiple folds are used, it includes the sum of all outputs. Labels on the x-axis represent the actual class, and labels on the y-axis represent the predicted class. The matrix is normalized per-row, so each cell represents the percentage of actual (based on row) samples that were classified as that column.
