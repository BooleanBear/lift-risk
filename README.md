### Abstract
Repeated lifting of heavy objects has been shown to create increased risk for incidences of lower back pain. While lifting objects cannot be entirely avoided in daily life, proper technique mitigates these risks. Determining when a person is lifting in a risky way can help a worker learn to avoid dangerous lifts and help the employer determine if the workplace layout is prone to requiring them. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning approach for detecting the risk level of an individual lift based on accelerometer and gyroscope data from various sensors placed on a worker’s body.
