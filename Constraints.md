# Constraints

* Research must be completed over the course of the academic year. The nature of research means that a fully viable solution may not be devised in this time frame; the goal is to have the best possible working model within the time frame.
* The objective is to research strategies for lift classification and develop machine learning models for this goal. The models will not be implemented in an active system.
* The devised solution should not require identifying information for any individuals using the system, such as age, height, weight, gender, etc. 
* The solution must work on as many members of the general population as possible. It must be general enough to work without being configured for each affected user.
* The solution must be viable to work in an industrial setting. It cannot be so invasive as to impede the ability of a worker or produce more risk than is present without the system.
* The solution should not require a significant technical understanding to use. Workers should not need to familiarize themselves with the system beyond knowledge of how to utilize the IMU sensors.
