# User Stories

NOTE: As this is a research-based project, user stories are not as well defined. I've included stories based on why this research is useful to end users, but the research itself may not result in outcomes that satisfy the stories. It may instead provide a theoretical basis for a project that does address the stories.

1. As a worker, I want a way to tell if I am lifting in an unsafe manner, so that I can learn to avoid such actions and reduce physical risk to myself.
2. As a manager, I want a way to tell if my workers often perform unsafe lifts, so that I can know if the workspace is set up in a way that unsafe lifts are required.
3. As a researcher, I want to determine if machine learning is a feasible approach for lift classification, so that I know a workable system can be built using it.
4. As a researcher, I want to learn about different data preprocessing techniques so that I can generate good input for machine learning systems.
